## Current Fix Queue

1. Visual QA with fresh light/dark screenshots after the current build, focusing on titlebar/sidebar/bottom color continuity.
2. Keep WidgetKit extension scope explicit: ST-07 previews all design variants, while the shipped extension currently exposes Now Playing and QuickAccess widgets.
